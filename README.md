Read the documentation.docx file for the new mathematical method developed besed of water based Reverse Engineering.

1. "Coeff_mat_generator/Coeff_mat_generator.cpp" file is used for generating Coefficient matrix mentioned in documentation.
2. This coefficient matrix along with measured volume changes is given as input to "eqn_solver.m" file which in turn solves the equation and outputs the answer.
